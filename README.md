# Assignment Overview
The primary objectives of this software design assignment are to develop and implement a restaurant management system using various well-established design patterns. The system is intended to simulate the operations of a restaurant by managing table allocations, food orders, and billing processes in a dynamic environment. The key aspects of the assignment involve integrating different design patterns to handle specific tasks within the system, providing a robust and flexible architecture that can be easily expanded or modified.

# Implementation Description 


For each assignment, please answer the following:

- Explain the level of flexibility in your implementation, including how new object types can
be easily added or removed in the future.
The restaurant management system is designed to be highly flexible:
State Pattern allows easy addition of new table states without modifying existing code.
Builder Pattern facilitates the inclusion of new food items and their attributes seamlessly.
Decorator Pattern makes it straightforward to introduce new food item enhancements.
Strategy Pattern enables dynamic swapping and addition of new pricing strategies.
Chain of Responsibility supports easy extension of request handling with minimal changes.

- Discuss the simplicity and understandability of your implementation, ensuring that it is
easy for others to read and maintain.
The system's design ensures it is easy to understand and maintain:
Clear Responsibilities: Each design pattern used has a well-defined role, improving clarity.
Modular Design: Components are segregated, which simplifies maintenance and scalability.
Well-Defined Interfaces: Interfaces and abstract classes provide clear contracts that guide further development.

- Describe how you have avoided duplicated code and why it is important.
Duplicated code is minimized by:
Utilizing Patterns: Design patterns facilitate code reuse and ensure consistency.
Abstract Classes/Interfaces: These elements centralize common functionality to avoid redundancy.

- If applicable, mention any design patterns you have used and explain why they were
chosen.
Design Patterns Utilized:
State Pattern: Used to manage the state of restaurant tables, enabling transitions between states like free, occupied, and reserved. This pattern helps encapsulate state-related behaviors within table objects, promoting cleaner code and easier maintenance.
Builder Pattern: Facilitates the complex creation of food items. By using this pattern, the system allows for a customizable process in constructing various types of food with different ingredients and decorations, without cluttering client code with numerous constructor parameters.
Decorator Pattern: Enhances food items by dynamically adding additional features such as extra sauces or cheese. This pattern allows for flexibility in modifying objects without altering the underlying structures, making it ideal for on-the-fly customizations in a restaurant setting.
Strategy Pattern: Implements different pricing strategies based on the time of day or specific promotions like happy hours and peak hours. This pattern provides a strategy interface and lets the context dynamically select the appropriate algorithm to apply based on external conditions.
Chain of Responsibility Pattern: Handles various types of requests such as orders, billing, and cleaning, in a decoupled manner. Each request is passed along a chain of handler objects until one of them handles the request. This setup simplifies the management of request processing and enhances the systemâ€™s extendibility.


# Maven Commands

We'll use Apache Maven to compile and run this project. You'll need to install Apache Maven (https://maven.apache.org/) on your system. 

Apache Maven is a build automation tool and a project management tool for Java-based projects. Maven provides a standardized way to build, package, and deploy Java applications.

Maven uses a Project Object Model (POM) file to manage the build process and its dependencies. The POM file contains information about the project, such as its dependencies, the build configuration, and the plugins used for building and packaging the project.

Maven provides a centralized repository for storing and accessing dependencies, which makes it easier to manage the dependencies of a project. It also provides a standardized way to build and deploy projects, which helps to ensure that builds are consistent and repeatable.

Maven also integrates with other development tools, such as IDEs and continuous integration systems, making it easier to use as part of a development workflow.

Maven provides a large number of plugins for various tasks, such as compiling code, running tests, generating reports, and creating JAR files. This makes it a versatile tool that can be used for many different types of Java projects.

## Compile
Type on the command line: 

```bash
mvn clean compile
```



## JUnit Tests
JUnit is a popular testing framework for Java. JUnit tests are automated tests that are written to verify that the behavior of a piece of code is as expected.

In JUnit, tests are written as methods within a test class. Each test method tests a specific aspect of the code and is annotated with the @Test annotation. JUnit provides a range of assertions that can be used to verify the behavior of the code being tested.

JUnit tests are executed automatically and the results of the tests are reported. This allows developers to quickly and easily check if their code is working as expected, and make any necessary changes to fix any issues that are found.

The use of JUnit tests is an important part of Test-Driven Development (TDD), where tests are written before the code they are testing is written. This helps to ensure that the code is written in a way that is easily testable and that all required functionality is covered by tests.

JUnit tests can be run as part of a continuous integration pipeline, where tests are automatically run every time changes are made to the code. This helps to catch any issues as soon as they are introduced, reducing the need for manual testing and making it easier to ensure that the code is always in a releasable state.

To run, use the following command:
```bash
mvn clean test
```


## Spotbugs 

SpotBugs is a static code analysis tool for Java that detects potential bugs in your code. It is an open-source tool that can be used as a standalone application or integrated into development tools such as Eclipse, IntelliJ, and Gradle.

SpotBugs performs an analysis of the bytecode generated from your Java source code and reports on any potential problems or issues that it finds. This includes things like null pointer exceptions, resource leaks, misused collections, and other common bugs.

The tool uses data flow analysis to examine the behavior of the code and detect issues that might not be immediately obvious from just reading the source code. SpotBugs is able to identify a wide range of issues and can be customized to meet the needs of your specific project.

Using SpotBugs can help to improve the quality and reliability of your code by catching potential bugs early in the development process. This can save time and effort in the long run by reducing the need for debugging and fixing issues later in the development cycle. SpotBugs can also help to ensure that your code is secure by identifying potential security vulnerabilities.

Use the following command:

```bash
mvn spotbugs:gui 
```

SpotBugs https://spotbugs.github.io/ is the spiritual successor of FindBugs.


## Checkstyle 

Checkstyle is a development tool for checking Java source code against a set of coding standards. It is an open-source tool that can be integrated into various integrated development environments (IDEs), such as Eclipse and IntelliJ, as well as build tools like Maven and Gradle.

Checkstyle performs static code analysis, which means it examines the source code without executing it, and reports on any issues or violations of the coding standards defined in its configuration. This includes issues like code style, code indentation, naming conventions, code structure, and many others.

By using Checkstyle, developers can ensure that their code adheres to a consistent style and follows best practices, making it easier for other developers to read and maintain. It can also help to identify potential issues before the code is actually run, reducing the risk of runtime errors or unexpected behavior.

Checkstyle is highly configurable and can be customized to fit the needs of your team or organization. It supports a wide range of coding standards and can be integrated with other tools, such as code coverage and automated testing tools, to create a comprehensive and automated software development process.

The following command will generate a report in HTML format that you can open in a web browser. 

```bash
mvn checkstyle:checkstyle
```
